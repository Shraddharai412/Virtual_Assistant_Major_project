const axios = require("axios");

const geminiResponse = async (command, assistantName, userName) => {
  try {
    const apiUrl = process.env.GEMINI_API_URL;

    const prompt = `You are a virtual assistant named ${assistantName} created by ${userName}.
You are not Google. You will now behave like a voice-enabled assistant.

Your task is to understand the user's natural language input and respond with a JSON object like this:

{
  "type": "general" | "google-search" | "youtube-search" | "youtube-play" |
          "get-time" | "get-date" | "get-day" | "get-month" | "calculator-open" |
          "instagram-open" | "facebook-open" | "weather-show",
  "userInput": "<original user input> {only remove your name from userinput if exists}",
  "response": "<a short spoken response to read out loud to the user>"
}

Instructions:
- "type": determine the intent of the user.
- "userInput": original sentence the user spoke (without assistant name).
- "response": A short voice-friendly reply, e.g., "Sure, playing it now", "Here's what I found", etc.

Type meanings:
- "general": if it's a factual or informational question.
aur agar koi aisa questions puchta hai jiska answer tume pata hai usko bhi general ki cateogry me rakho bas short answers dena

- "google-search": if user wants to search something on Google.
- "youtube-search": if user wants to search something on YouTube.
- "youtube-play": if user wants to directly play a video or song.
- "calculator-open": if user wants to open a calculator.
- "instagram-open": if user wants to open Instagram.
- "facebook-open": if user wants to open Facebook.
- "weather-show": if user wants to know weather.
- "get-time": if user asks for current time.
- "get-date": if user asks for today's date.



Important:
- If someone asks who created you, include ${userName} in the response.
- You must strictly output only the valid JSON object without any explanation, markdown, or formatting.
- Do not include anything before or after the JSON object.

User input: ${command}
`;

    const result = await axios.post(apiUrl, {
      contents: [
        {
          parts: [{ text: prompt }],
        },
      ],
    });

    const text = result.data.candidates[0].content.parts[0].text;

    return text; // raw response (JSON string)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("‚ùå Gemini API error:", error.response?.data || error.message);
    return null;
  }
};

module.exports = geminiResponse;
